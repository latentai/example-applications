Congratulations, you have a compiled model! Now it is time to deploy it in your target device.

In this repository, example applications for the LatentAI recipe models are presented for both C++ and Python.

We maintain different branches to align with both current and recent older SDK releases.  Please ensure that you are working off of the branch that matches the version of your installed SDK.  _In most cases, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest SDK._

To determine the LEIP SDK you are using, you may use the following command inside the docker container:

`leip version`

Example application branches are provided for the following SDK Versions:

- [2.8.2](https://github.com/latentai/example-applications/tree/2.8)
- [2.9](https://github.com/latentai/example-applications/tree/2.9)

Please see the specific branches above for more further instructions, release notes and other information.
