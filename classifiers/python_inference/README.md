# LatentAI LRE - Classifier Inference Python example 

This folder contains a python script that employs the LRE package to run an inference example. To run this inference example, do the following:

1. Copy the Python LRE object `Float32-package` and `Int8-package` to the device.
2. Edit `FLOAT32_PACKAGE` and `INT8_PACKAGE` in the [script](inference_commands.bash) to point to the package directories.
3. Run `bash inference_commands.bash`

All the required packages have been precompiled and are part of the LRE package.
